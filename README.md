#  Convolutional Neural Network on CIFAR10 Dataset
This project is one of my Deep Learning projects. For this project, we have the [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset that contains 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images in each class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

The goal of this project is to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify CIFAR images.
